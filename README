DoRest is a small, lightweight framework to develop RESTful WebService in Scala.

DoRest's primary goal is to make the server-side development of RESTful 
WebServices fun.

To this end, we try to provide an API that is easy and intuitive to use and that
makes applications developed using the framework easy do comprehend and debug.
To achieve this property we try to avoid using constructs that do things in 
behind or implicitly. 

This framework is an open source framework. Use at your own risk (see License.txt 
for further details.)
