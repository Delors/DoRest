DoRest is a small, lightweight framework to develop RESTful WebService in Scala.

DoRest's primary goal is to make the server-side development of RESTful WebServices fun.

To this end, we try to provide an API that is easy and intuitive to use and that makes applications developed using the framework easy do comprehend and debug.

This framework is – and will always be – an open source framework. Use at your own risk.
