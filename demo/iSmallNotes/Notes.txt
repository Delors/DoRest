Notes:
- one note can have multiple tags
- one user can define multiple tags
- each user (implicitly) defines a tag with its name that is automatically associated with every note that the user creates
- one or more users can share the same Tag
- a tag can be used by multiple users
- a tag can be associated with multiple notes
- a user can only delete its specific instance of the tag (a note without any tag will be garbage collected)
