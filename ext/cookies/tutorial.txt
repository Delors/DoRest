- Overview
This text describes how to use cookies in your DoRest application.

- Required package
Maven:

<dependency>
	<groupId>org.dorest</groupId>
	<artifactId>org.dorest.ext.cookies</artifactId>
</dependency>

- How to use
The cookies package helps you to read cookies from the html request and supports setting new cookies.

Therefore, add the Cookies trait to your RESTInterface.

	class NameResource extends RESTInterface with Cookies
	
Now two different types of cookies are accessible within your RESTInterface:
	Request Cookies - Sent from the client to your application
	Response Cookies - Sent from your application to the client

Set Cookies
You can set new cookies within the request handlers. Therefore, call "set cookie <name> value <value> <additional parameters".

class SetNameResource extends RESTInterface with HTMLSupport with Cookies {
    get returns HTML {
        //the user name is given as get parameter. Extract it from the request url.
        val name = extractNameFromUrl
        
        //now set a cookie with the extracted name
        set cookie "name" value name path "/index" maxAge 60
        
Receive cookies

The cookies send by the client are available via cookie <name> or cookies for all available cookies.

class NameResource extends RESTInterface with HTMLSupport with Cookies {
    get returns HTML {
        //try to find the cookie that contains the user name
        val nameCookie = cookie("name")
