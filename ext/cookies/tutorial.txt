- Overview
This text describes how to use cookies in your DoRest application.

- Required package
You need the org.dorest.ext.cookies project from DoRest 

Maven:
<dependency>
	<groupId>org.dorest</groupId>
	<artifactId>org.dorest.ext.cookies</artifactId>
</dependency>

- How to use
The cookies project allows you to access cookies from the http request and enables you to send new cookies to the client.

In order to make use of cookies, add the Cookies trait to your REST Handler.

	class NameResource extends RESTInterface with Cookies
	
Now two different types of cookies are accessible within your RESTInterface:
	Request Cookies - Sent from the client to your application
	Response Cookies - Sent from your application to the client

Set Cookies
You can set new cookies within the request handlers. Therefore, call "set cookie <name> value <value> <additional parameters>".

E.g. set a cookie with name "username" and value "Andreas" which is available for 10 minutes
class SetNameResource extends RESTInterface with HTMLSupport with Cookies {
    get returns HTML {        
        //now set a cookie with the extracted name
        set cookie "username" value "Andreas" maxAge 600
        
Receive cookies

The cookies send by the client are available via cookie <name> or cookies for all available cookies.

E.g. get the cookie object with name "username"
class NameResource extends RESTInterface with HTMLSupport with Cookies {
    get returns HTML {
        //try to find the cookie that contains the user name
        val nameCookie = cookie("username")
